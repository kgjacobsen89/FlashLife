# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# User.create([{
# 	 first_name: 'Khai',
# 	 last_name: 'Ly',
# 	 email: info@flashlifephotobooth.com
# 	 phone_numer:
# 	 address:
# 	 password_digest:
